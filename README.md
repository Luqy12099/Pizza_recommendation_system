### Pizza Recommendation System using Content Filtering

This repository contains the implementation of a recommendation system for pizza using content filtering, specifically employing the Pearson Correlation algorithm. The system suggests pizza options based on similarities in their characteristics.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the ["Pizza Flavor Recommender System" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alibuttj/pizza-flavor-recommender-system) by MUHAMMAD ALI MAZHAR BUTT.

Within this dataset, the "Pizza Flavors Sheet.xlsx" is utilized. This sheet contains specifications for each pizza, with data organized in columns representing attributes such as Spice Level, Pepperoni, Beef, Marinated Chicken, Chicken, Tomato, Whole Wheat, Capsicum, Olives, Sauce, Pepper, Pesto, Mushroom, Cheese, and Vegetable.
